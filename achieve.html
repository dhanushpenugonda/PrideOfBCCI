                <img src="achieve/1983.jpg" class="center" width="392"height="294"/> 
                <p>This is biggest achievement of Indian cricket team till date. 25th June 1983, India beats defending champion West Indies in the final by 43 runs. When Indian captain Kapil Dev lifts the World Cup at Lords in England, the World gets the 2nd champion of the ODI cricket after West Indies. Man of the Match in the Final & Semi-final Mohinder Amarnaths all-round performance in the tournament helps India to become the World Champion.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br>In the first semi-final, at Old Trafford on 22 June, England won the toss and elected to bat. The English batsmen mistimed many balls and used the bat's edge frequently, as the restrictive Indian bowling led England to score 213 (all out, 60 overs). Graeme Fowler (33 from 59 balls, 3 fours) top scored, and Kapil Dev took 3 for 35 in eleven overs, with Mohinder Amarnath and Roger Binny taking two wickets each. In reply, Yashpal Sharma (61 from 115 balls, 3 fours, 2 sixes) and Sandeep Patil (51 from 32 balls, 8 fours) made half-centuries, as India reached their target in 54.4 overs, winning by 6 wickets in a classic victory over the previous tournament's runners-up. Mohinder Amarnath (46 from 92 balls, 4 fours, 1 six) picked up the man-of-the-match award for his all round performance, which saw him add 46 runs to his earlier bowling success (2/27 in 12 overs).<br>In the final, India lost the toss and were asked to bat first against the West Indies. Only Krishnamachari Srikkanth (38 from 57 balls) and Mohinder Amarnath (26 from 80 balls) put up any significant resistance as Roberts, Marshall, Joel Garner and Michael Holding ripped through the Indian batsmen, ably supported by Gomes. Surprising resistance by the tail allowed India to compile 183 (all out, 54.4 overs). The Indian bowling exploited the weather and pitch conditions perfectly to bowl out the West Indies for 140 from 52 overs, winning by 43 runs and completing one of the most stunning upsets in cricket history. It still remains the lowest ever total successfully defended in a World Cup final. Amarnath and Madan Lal each took three wickets. Viv Richards, was West Indies' top scorer with 33 from 28 balls. Amarnath was the most economical bowler, conceding just 12 runs from his seven overs, while taking 3 wickets, and was once again awarded the Man of the Match award for his all-round performance. There was no 'Man of the Series' awarded in 1983.</span></p>

Pakistan on the other hand, though getting off to a good start failed to maintain consistency and were restricted to just 231 runs while being bowled out in 49.5 overs. India won the match and confirmed their place in the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final.

                <p>India held their nerve, England lost theirs. When Morgan and Bopara were going England were in control, but that over from Ishant (who had been expensive) changed the game in the blink of an eye and England could not get back in the game. Did Dhoni really plan to use Ishant as he did? He may explain a little later. India's spinners, Jadeja and Ashwin, were outstanding on a pitch with plenty of assistance. So India have now won the World T20, the World Cup and the Champions Trophy 20/50. It also has to be said that India were the best, most consistent team, in this tournament. This was the only match where their batting struggled and their bowlers bailed them out. I'll, of course, be staying around to bring you the presentation shortly.</p>
                <p>It was also a historic day for Indian captain Dhoni who became the first-ever skipper in history to win all three ICC tournaments. In 2007, Dhoni had led a fairly inexperienced Team India to ICC World T20 triumph before ending the country's 28-year wait for the ICC World Cup title.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more2"><br>India had dominated the tournament from the first match to semi final match. They beat South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan in assertive wins to be the group champions of Group B. They brought their strong performance to the semi final match too where they beat Sri Lanka by 8 wickets to reach the final for the third time after 2000 and 2002.[11] 2 century & 1 half century from Shikhar Dhawan powered the Indian batting line up. Ravindra Jadeja was the leader from the front of the Indian bowling line up. India didn't lose a single match since the start of the tournament with winning both of their practice matches too. </span></p><button onclick="myFunction2()" id="myBtn2">Road to Finals</button>

                <p>Team India became the first ever team to whitewash Australia in a Twenty20 International (T20I) series. India registered a 3-0 white wash over Australia in the third and final T20I at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Sunday, as they beat Australia by seven wickets. Shane Watson had a phenomenal game, but in the end India’s collective effort trumped his individual brilliance.With this win, India have become the No. 1 ranked side in T20Is. They also became the first team to ever whitewash Australia in Australia in a three-match series of any format. It was once again all about India’s top three batsmen, with Shikhar Dhawan getting off to a rollicking start.</p>

                <p>India pulled off a historic three-wicket win at Gabba on January 19, thanks to Gill's 91,Pujara's temperment and  Rishabh Pant’s unbeaten 89-run knock which helped India realise the dream of an outright series win. The win at the Gabba on the final day meant that India have won an unprecedented back-to-back Test series Down Under.</p>

                <p>Partnership between shardul and sundar in 1st innings made India to be in game till the end.Then on final day late hitting from Pant and debutant Washington Sundar (22 off 29) saw the depleted tourists home, ending Australia's unbeaten streak at the ground, which lasted more than 32 years.It marks the third straight series win against Australia for India, and two in a row on Australian soil.</p>

                <p>Australia took the Test mace from South Africa's hands in 2016 but Kohli's India was only getting ready to take the cricketing world by storm.India decimated New Zealand (3-0), England (4-0) in the 2016-17 season and defeated Australia (2-1) the same season. In 2017, Kohli's men went to Sri Lanka handed them a 3-0 bashing on their own turf. As a result of such one-sided results, the Indian team continued to add points to their tally and remained top of the ICC Test Rankings in 2017 as well as 2018.<br>In the 2018-19 season, India defeated West Indies at home and also became the first side from the sub-continent to beat the Australians in a Test series in their own home. Kohli & Co. lifted the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to scale the heights that no one had in Indian cricket before. As a result, the year 2019 also ended with India at the Number Uno position.
                  <br>ndia arrived in Australia with the hopes of retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and did just that. Though Kohli had to return home for the birth of his baby, Ajinkya Rahane led the team phenomenally as several rookies rose to the occasion to grab the opportunity with both hands. The 2-1 victory over Australia Down Under and a dominant home series triumph over England (3-1) ensured India succeeded in winning the ICC Test Mace for the year 2020 as well.</p>
